# Weather MCP Server

This project implements a simple Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that exposes tools for retrieving current weather information, forecasts and alerts using the [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) API.

See [aka.ms/nuget/mcp/guide](https://aka.ms/nuget/mcp/guide) for the full guide.

Please note that this template is currently in an early preview stage. If you have feedback, please take a [brief survey](http://aka.ms/dotnet-mcp-template-survey).

## Checklist before publishing to NuGet.org

- Test the MCP server locally using the steps below.
- Update the package metadata in the .csproj file, in particular the `<PackageId>`.
- Update `.mcp/server.json` to declare your MCP server's inputs.
  - See [configuring inputs](https://aka.ms/nuget/mcp/guide/configuring-inputs) for more details.
- Pack the project using `dotnet pack`.

The `bin/Release` directory will contain the package file (.nupkg), which can be [published to NuGet.org](https://learn.microsoft.com/nuget/nuget-org/publish-a-package).

## Developing locally

To test this MCP server from source code (locally) without using a built MCP server package, you can configure your IDE to run the project directly using `dotnet run`.

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "WeatherMcpServer": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "dotnet",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--project",
        "<PATH TO PROJECT DIRECTORY>"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Configuration

This server uses the OpenWeatherMap API. Set the `OPENWEATHER_API_KEY` environment variable before running the server:

```bash
export OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=<your-key>
```

## Testing the MCP Server

Once configured with your API key you can interact with the following tools:

- `get_current_weather` – returns current weather conditions for a city.
- `get_weather_forecast` – returns a short term forecast.
- `get_weather_alerts` – returns active alerts if available.

For example you can ask: `What's the weather in Paris?` and the assistant will call the `get_current_weather` tool from this server.

### Running tests

Unit and integration tests can be executed with `dotnet test`. Integration tests require a valid `OPENWEATHER_API_KEY` environment variable to be set so that real requests can be performed against OpenWeatherMap. The GitHub Actions workflow sets this variable from the repository secrets when running tests.

## Publishing to NuGet.org

1. Run `dotnet pack -c Release` to create the NuGet package
2. Publish to NuGet.org with `dotnet nuget push bin/Release/*.nupkg --api-key <your-api-key> --source https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json`

## Using the MCP Server from NuGet.org

Once the MCP server package is published to NuGet.org, you can configure it in your preferred IDE. Both VS Code and Visual Studio use the `dnx` command to download and install the MCP server package from NuGet.org.

- **VS Code**: Create a `<WORKSPACE DIRECTORY>/.vscode/mcp.json` file
- **Visual Studio**: Create a `<SOLUTION DIRECTORY>\.mcp.json` file

For both VS Code and Visual Studio, the configuration file uses the following server definition:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "WeatherMcpServer": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "dnx",
      "args": [
        "WeatherMcpServer",
        "--version",
        "0.1.0-beta",
        "--yes"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
